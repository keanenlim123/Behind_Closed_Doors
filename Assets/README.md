# Game Objective
The objective of Behind Closed Doors is to raise awareness of youth mental health challenges through immersive virtual reality storytelling.

Through exploration and reflection, players learn to recognise subtle behavioural and environmental warning signs that may otherwise go unnoticed. By placing players in the role of a caregiver, the experience promotes empathy, emotional awareness, and compassionate observation.

Rather than focusing on diagnosis, the game encourages open conversations, reduces stigma, and reinforces the importance of emotional support and help seeking behaviour. The project demonstrates how VR can serve as a meaningful tool for empathy building and social impact.
